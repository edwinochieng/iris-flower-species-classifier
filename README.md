# Iris Flower Species Classifier

This is a simple project that demonstrates the use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying Iris flower species.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. It consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor).

## Requirements

- scikit-learn
